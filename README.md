# React-Native-CallLog

Application will be some kind of calls logger. On main screen there will be a google map that shows currentÂ device position and list of missing calls with device coordinates when particular call was missed.

The goal is to prepare application that uses external libraries to show how they could be integrated in React Native app.I will use two type of libraries: one that needs linking and second that can be used without linking. Also I will show how we could use phone state to make some actions in React code, in our case missing call event. I will also use Native Base as my bootstrap.
